# Repo Finder 🔍

A web application built as part of Phase 2, Week 6 to demonstrate mastery of Asynchronous JavaScript and API Integration. This tool fetches and displays user profile data and a list of repositories directly from the GitHub REST API.

# 🚀 Features
Asynchronous Data Fetching: Uses async/await to handle multiple API requests efficiently.

Dynamic UI: Injects GitHub user data (avatar, bio, repo count) into the DOM.

Repository List: Automatically generates an ordered list of all public repositories for a specific user.

Responsive Design: Built with Bootstrap for a clean look on all devices.

# 🛠️ Technologies Used
JavaScript (ES6+): fetch API and async/await syntax.

HTML5/CSS3: Structured for accessibility.

Bootstrap 5: For rapid, responsive styling.

GitHub REST API: The primary data source.

# 💻 How to Run
Open the project in your GitHub Codespace.

Use a "Live Server" extension or simply open the index.html file in your browser.

The app will automatically fetch the data for the hardcoded username or via a search input.

# 📝 Learning Objectives (Phase 2, Week 6)
Understanding the Event Loop and Asynchrony.

Handling Promises and avoiding "Callback Hell."

Managing API errors with try/catch blocks.
